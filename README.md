---

## 🌟 Features

- **100% Non-Torrent (Zero P2P):** No seeders, no torrent clients, and no IP seeding exposure. Streams directly from fast cloud storage and HTTP/HLS CDNs.
- **56 Cloud Scraper Providers:** Extracts streams across 56 scrapers including *4KHDHub, Vadapav, HindMoviez, RiveStream, LookMovie, VidLink, Movy, Videasy, Cinejoy, FlyStream, X-Downloader, Vuflix, FSOnline, KissKH, Megasource, Nova, Purstream*, and more.
- **TorBox Debrid Integration:**
  - **Batch Cache Checking:** Instantly checks up to 100 links in a single API query (`/webdl/checkcached`), cutting scraper turnaround by 2-3 seconds.
  - **1-Click Cloud Caching:** Direct "⚡ Cache to TorBox" links in Nuvio and the Web Dashboard. Submits uncached links to TorBox's WebDL downloader in 1 click.
  - **High-Speed CDN Playback:** Streams cached hoster files through TorBox's ultra-fast Indian and global CDN nodes with full byte-range HTTP 206 seeking in Nuvio (MPV player).
  - **Strict Privacy Guarantee:** Your TorBox API key is strictly manual-input only. It is saved in gitignored `data/config.json` and is **never** auto-scanned from personal directories or leaked in stream titles or GitHub commits.
- **Short-Term Scrape Cache (12m TTL):** In-memory LRU ring buffer that caches scraped streams for 12 minutes. Repeated playback, switching streams, or backing out in Nuvio is instantaneous (0ms).
- **Fast Dead-Link Filter:** Rapid 1200ms parallel HEAD probe on direct stream links to purge 404/broken file hoster links before they hit Nuvio.
- **Live Ratings & Tomatometer (OMDb API):** Live IMDb ratings (`⭐ 8.8 IMDb`), Rotten Tomatoes tomatometer (`🍅 86% RT`), and Metacritic scores (`Ⓜ️ 74 Metascore`) stamped directly onto stream cards and `/meta` detail responses.
- **Fanart.tv ClearLogos & 4K Artwork:** Transparent ClearLogo PNGs (`hdmovielogo`/`clearlogo`) and crystal-clear 4K backdrops for Nuvio's hero title banner, with automatic fallback to Metahub CDN.
- **TheTVDB Episode Mappings:** Episode mapping for anime, cartoons, and Indian serials. Resolves absolute episode numbers (e.g. `Episode 1089` instead of `S21E72`) and episode titles so scrapers never miss anime releases.
- **Stream Filtering Profiles:**
  - **Clean Drawer Mode:** Automatically strips low-grade CAM, TS, PreDVD, and Telesync releases when high-quality WEB-DL or BluRay copies exist.
  - **Max Resolution Cap:** Configurable resolution limits (`4K`, `1080p Max`, `720p Max`) for bandwidth-constrained or TV devices.
  - **Audio Language Prioritization:** Select your preferred audio language (`Hindi`, `English`, `Tamil`, `Telugu`, `Malayalam`, `Kannada`, `Bengali`, `Punjabi`, `Dual Audio`) to boost matching releases to the very top.
- **Smart Stream Deduplication:** Merges identical CDN streams from multiple providers into a single card with combined tags (e.g. `HubCloud [Direct] (MoviesDrive + Vega)`).
- **Inbuilt Native Badges & Indian Regional OTT Logos:** Native bracketed headers (`[4K] [Remux] [HDR] [Hindi]`) rendered directly as colored badge pills in Nuvio, with logos for **JioHotstar, SonyLIV, Zee5, JioCinema, SunNXT, Aha, Hoichoi, ManoramaMAX, Chaupal, Planet Marathi, MX Player, Lionsgate, Shemaroo, and Voot**.
- **4 Rich Media Catalogs:**
  - 🎬 **YouTube Indian Cinema:** Bollywood classics, South Indian Hindi dubbed movies, comedy, and web series.
  - 🌍 **YouTube International:** Curated action, sci-fi, thriller, documentaries, and indie films.
  - 🏛️ **Internet Archive Classics:** Golden Era Hollywood, film noir, silent cinema, classic horror, and vintage Indian cinema.
  - 📺 **Dailymotion Indian & Global:** Hindi movies, dramas, Pakistani serials, and international titles.
- **Embedded Streaming Proxy (`/proxy`):** Transparently forwards protected HLS (`.m3u8`) playlists and injects required `Referer`, `Origin`, and `User-Agent` headers so that Nuvio's internal player plays restricted streams without HTTP 403 errors.
- **Interactive Web Dashboard (`/configure`):** Dark-mode web interface to test scrape titles, toggle scrapers, manage your TorBox key, configure filtering profiles, inspect live supported hosters, and check for updates.
- **Android TV & Mobile APK:** Native Flutter client for NVIDIA Shield, Fire TV, Google TV, and Android phones with full D-pad remote navigation and 24/7 background foreground service.

## 🔄 Upstream & Cloudstream Extension Sync

### 1. PlayTorrioV3 Native Scrapers
`HostHound` is integrated directly with upstream [ayman708-UX/PlayTorrioV3](https://github.com/ayman708-UX/PlayTorrioV3).
- To sync latest providers and fixes:
  - Click **🔄 Check Upstream Updates** in the Web Dashboard (`/configure`), or trigger `POST /api/pipeline/update`.
  - The server clones upstream, scans `lib/upstream/services/scraper/sites/`, regenerates `scraper_registry.dart`, and hot-reloads all active scrapers without restarting.

### 2. Cloudstream Scrapers & Plugins
- Native Dart ports of top Cloudstream extractors (*HubCloud, Vega, DriveSeed, Pixeldrain, Mega, 1fichier*) are maintained directly inside `lib/upstream/services/cloudstream/`.
- In-memory plugin repos can be browsed and refreshed via the embedded `CloudStreamMarketplaceService`.

## ✨ Vibe Coded Philosophy & Manifesto

> *"Code at the speed of thought. Guided by vibes, verified by automated test suites."*

This entire codebase — spanning 56 stream scrapers, dynamic HLS proxying, TorBox cloud debrid caching, cross-platform Android TV / mobile interfaces, and live update pipelines — is **100% Vibe Coded**.

### What does "Vibe Coded" mean here?
- **AI-Native Architecture**: Conceived, architected, debugged, and refined through symbiotic interaction between human vision and autonomous AI coding agents (DeepMind Antigravity / Gemini / Claude).
- **Rapid Self-Healing**: Automated QA loops, subagent audits, real-time JavaScript validation (`node -c`), and endpoint stress-testing catch edge cases before they ship.
- **Vibe Velocity**: Shipped iteratively at extreme velocity without bureaucratic technical debt — continuously evolving as streaming protocols, hosters, and community conventions update.
- **As-Is Provision**: As with all vibe-coded software, it is offered purely as open-source research and experimental tooling. Enjoy the vibes responsibly!
